## Picsum API Integration
The project uses the Picsum API to fetch random images. This API is great for generating placeholder images and practicing image handling in a React app.

## Key Features
Fetching Images: Images are fetched from the Picsum API using the fetch method in Reactâ€™s useEffect hook.

Pagination: The gallery supports pagination with "Previous" and "Next" buttons, allowing users to navigate through different pages of images.

Shimmer Effect: A shimmer loading effect is displayed while the images are being fetched, enhancing the user experience.

Responsive Design: The layout is responsive, making use of Bootstrap for grid and component styling.
